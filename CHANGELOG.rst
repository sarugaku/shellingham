1.5.0 (2022-08-04)
==================

Features
--------

- Drop support for Python version older than 3.4.  `#50 <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/50>`_
- Support detecting NuShell.  `#56 <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/56>`_


1.4.0 (2021-02-01)
==================

Features
--------

- On Windows, the full path to the shell executable is now returned instead of
  just the base name.  `#42 <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/42>`_


1.3.2 (2020-02-12)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Parse argument list to detect shells run via an interpreter, e.g. xonsh via Python.  `#27 <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/27>`_


1.3.1 (2019-04-10)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix a typo that prevents ash and csh from being detected.  `#24
  <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/24>`_


1.3.0 (2019-03-06)
==================

Features
--------

- Add `Almquist shell <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell>`_
  (``ash``) detection support.  `#20
  <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/20>`_


1.2.8 (2018-12-16)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Parse ``ps`` output according to how it is actually formatted, instead of
  incorrectly using ``shlex.split()``.  `#14
  <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/14>`_

- Improve process parsing on Windows to so executables with non-ASCII names are
  handled better.  `#16 <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/16>`_


1.2.7 (2018-10-15)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Suppress subprocess errors from ``ps`` if the output is empty.  `#15
  <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/15>`_


1.2.6 (2018-09-14)
==================

No significant changes.


1.2.5 (2018-09-14)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Improve ``/proc`` content parsing robustness to not fail with non-decodable
  command line arguments.  `#10
  <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/10>`_


1.2.4 (2018-07-27)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix exception on Windows when the executable path is too long to fit into the
  PROCESSENTRY32 struct. Generally the shell shouldn't be buried this deep, and
  we can always fix it when that actually happens, if ever.  `#8
  <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/8>`_


1.2.3 (2018-07-10)
=======================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Check a processâ€™s argument list is valid before peeking into it. This works
  around a Heisenbug in VS Code, where a process read from ``/proc`` may
  contain an empty argument list.


1.2.2 (2018-07-09)
==================

Features
--------

- Support BSD-style ``/proc`` format.  `#4
  <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/4>`_


Bug Fixes
---------

- Better ``ps`` output decoding to fix compatibility.  `#7
  <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/7>`_


1.2.1 (2018-07-04)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix login shell detection if it is ``chsh``-ed to point to an absolute path.
  `#6 <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/6>`_


1.2.0 (2018-07-04)
==================

Features
--------

- Prefer the ``/proc``-based approach on POSIX whenever it is likely to work.
  `#5 <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/5>`_


1.1.0 (2018-06-19)
==================

Features
--------

- Use ``/proc`` on Linux to build process tree. This is more reliable than
  ``ps``, which may not be available on a bare installation.  `#3
  <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/3>`_


1.0.1 (2018-06-19)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix POSIX usage on Python 2 by providing more compatible arguments to parse
  ``ps`` results. Thanks to @glehmann for the patch.  `#2
  <https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham/issues/2>`_


1.0.0.dev1 (2018-06-15)
=======================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Prevent the lookup from exploding when running in non-hierarchical process
  structure. (1-b2e9bef5)
